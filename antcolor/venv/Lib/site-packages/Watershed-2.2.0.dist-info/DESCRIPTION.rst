Consult the module API page at

      https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/distWatershed/Watershed-2.2.0.html

for all information related to this module, including information related
to the latest changes to the code.  The page at the URL shown above lists
all of the module functionality you can invoke in your own code.  That page
also describes how you can directly access the segmented blobs in your own
code and how you can apply a color filter to an image before its segmentation.

With regard to the basic purpose of the module, it is a Python
implementation of the watershed algorithm for image segmentation.  The goal
of this module is not to compete with the popular OpenCV implementation of
the watershed algorithm.  On the other hand, the goal here is to provide an
alternative framework that is more amenable to experimentation with the
logic of watershed segmentation.

Typical usage syntax:

::

        from Watershed import *
        shed = Watershed(
                   data_image = "orchid0001.jpg",
                   binary_or_gray_or_color = "color",
                   size_for_calculations = 128,
                   sigma = 1,
                   gradient_threshold_as_fraction = 0.1,
                   level_decimation_factor = 16,
                   padding = 20,
               )
        shed.extract_data_pixels()
        shed.display_data_image()
        shed.mark_image_regions_for_gradient_mods()                     #(A)
        shed.compute_gradient_image()
        shed.modify_gradients_with_marker_minima()                      #(B)
        shed.compute_Z_level_sets_for_gradient_image()
        shed.propagate_influence_zones_from_bottom_to_top_of_Z_levels()
        shed.display_watershed()
        shed.display_watershed_in_color()
        shed.extract_watershed_contours_seperated()
        shed.display_watershed_contours_in_color()

    The statements in lines (A) and (B) are needed only for marker-assisted
    segmentation with the module.  For a fully automated implemented of the
    BLM algorithm, you would need to delete those two statements.
