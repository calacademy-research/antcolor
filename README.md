# antcolor

This project aims to use data housed in AntWeb.org to quantify ant coloration and compare it across a variety of parameters. 
Heavily utilizes Elasticsearch and OpenCV.
Includes scripts to import AntWeb data into Elasticsearch, extract and save color from ant images to Elasticsearch, and (soon!) analyze Elasticsearch ant data in R.
Repo will also include other color and image analysis projects related to AntWeb.

Big questions include: 
1. Does color in ants change with latitude, temperature, elevation or UV-B radiation exposure? 
2. Is color at all related to habitat or microhabitat, and if so why? 
3. To what extent is color conserved across clades and/or genera?
